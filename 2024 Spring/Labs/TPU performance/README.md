This folder contains files needed for Lab_5 (TPU Performance). The main purpose of this lab is to get you started on using TPUs to train DL models. For now, you can only access TPUs from Google Colab, which is a product from Google Research that is completely running on cloud and allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser(Thank YOU, Google!)

To get started, please do the following:

Step 1: please log in to https://colab.research.google.com/ using your Google account. (Note: you can't use your UVa email to access Google Colab unfortunately)

Step 2: upload the notebooks to the Google Drive associated with the Google account from Step 1

Step 3: open the .ipynb file in Google Colab, or directly from Google Drive

Step 4: click Runtime and select Change Runtime Type, and Set "TPU" as the hardware accelerator before you run the notebooks

Step 5: Enjoy the free TPUs (Thank YOU again, Google!)
