/u/mi3se/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/crypten-0.4.0-py3.9.egg/crypten/nn/onnx_converter.py:164: UserWarning: The given NumPy array is not writeable, and PyTorch does not support non-writeable tensors. This means you can write to the underlying (supposedly non-writeable) NumPy array using the tensor. You may want to copy the array to protect its data or make it writeable before converting it to a tensor. This type of warning will be suppressed for the rest of this program.
